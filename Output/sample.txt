1 Heat olive oil in a large thick-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté 4 minutes, add the garlic and cook a minute more. Add parsley and stir 2 minutes. Add tomato and tomato paste, and gently cook for 10 minutes or so.
2 Add clam juice, dry white wine, and fish. Bring to a simmer and simmer until the fish is cooked through and easily flakes apart, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add seasoning —salt, pepper, oregano, thyme, Tabasco. Add more salt and pepper to taste. Ladle into bowls and serve.
Great served with crusty bread for dipping in the fish stew broth.
